Ah, youâ€™re probably thinking of **BlackArch**, a repository of penetration testing tools that can be integrated into Manjaro Linux. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

### **Steps to Install BlackArch Tools on Manjaro**

1. **Add the BlackArch Repository** Run these commands in your terminal:
    
    
    ```bash
    curl -Os https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
    chmod +x strap.sh
    sudo ./strap.sh
    ```
    
    This will add the BlackArch repository to your system.
    
2. **Update Your System** After adding the repository, update your package list:
    
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```
    
3. **Install All Tools** To install all tools from the BlackArch repository:
    
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S blackarch
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can install tools by category (e.g., webapp, scanner, cracker):
    
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S blackarch-webapp
    ```
    

### **Important Notes**

- BlackArch includes **hundreds of tools**, so installing everything might take up a lot of space and could cause conflicts. Itâ€™s better to install only the tools you need.
    
- If you encounter issues, try clearing the cache:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    sudo pacman -Sc
    ```

# if there is an error

It looks like your system is struggling to download the **BlackArch database** due to a connection timeout. This usually happens when the selected mirror is down or slow. Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

### **1. Try a Different Mirror**

BlackArch has multiple mirrors. You can manually update your mirror list:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/blackarch-mirrorlist
```

Replace the current mirror with one of these:
**Note**: if everything is commented, you can just uncomment the server you want e.g Germany, India


```bash
Server = https://mirror.blackarch.org/$repo/os/$arch
Server = http://blackarch.mirror.digitalpacific.com.au/$repo/os/$arch
Server = http://mirror.easyname.at/blackarch/$repo/os/$arch
```

Save the file and then run:



```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

### **2. Check Your Internet Connection**

Ensure your internet is stable. If possible, try switching networks or using a VPN to bypass regional restrictions.

### **3. Clear Pacman Cache**

Sometimes, clearing the cache helps:


```bash
sudo pacman -Sc
```

Then retry:

bash

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```
