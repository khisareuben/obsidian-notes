## Backend (Job‑Ready)

- **Framework:** **Django** (Python) — trusted in startups and enterprises, strong demand for Python + Django skills.
    
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** — industry standard, often paired with Django in production.
    
- **API Layer:** **Django REST Framework (DRF)** — almost every Django job that involves modern web apps expects DRF experience.
    
- **Authentication:** **django‑allauth** — widely used for user management, social logins, and integrates smoothly with DRF.
    

## 🎨 Frontend (Job‑Ready)

- **Framework:** **React** — the most in‑demand frontend framework worldwide, with huge job market presence.
    
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** — modern utility‑first CSS framework, increasingly popular in professional React projects.
    
- **Build Tool:** **Vite** — fast bundler, now standard in React + Tailwind setups.
    
- **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit** — still the most recognized state management solution in job postings, even if lighter options exist.

# How to start


## Backend First (Django + DRF + PostgreSQL)

1. **Learn Python basics**
    
    - Variables, loops, functions, classes.
        
    - Practice small projects (scripts, simple apps).
        
2. **Django fundamentals**
    
    - Install Django, create a project, understand apps.
        
    - Learn models, views, templates, and the admin panel.
        
3. **Database integration**
    
    - Install PostgreSQL.
        
    - Connect Django to PostgreSQL, practice migrations.
        
4. **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
    
    - Build APIs (serializers, viewsets, routers).
        
    - Test endpoints with Postman or Django’s browsable API.
        
5. **Authentication**
    
    - Add `django‑allauth` for user registration and login.
        
    - Secure your API with JWT or session authentication.
        

## 🎨 Frontend Next (React + Tailwind + Vite + Redux)

1. **HTML & CSS basics**
    
    - Even though Tailwind will handle most styling, know the fundamentals.
        
2. **React fundamentals**
    
    - Components, props, state, hooks.
        
    - Build small apps (to‑do list, weather app).
        
3. **Tailwind CSS**
    
    - Install Tailwind with Vite.
        
    - Practice styling React components with utility classes.
        
4. **State management with Redux Toolkit**
    
    - Learn slices, reducers, actions.
        
    - Connect Redux to your React app for global state.
        
5. **API integration**
    
    - Fetch data from your Django DRF backend.
        
    - Display it in React components styled with Tailwind.
        

## 🔗 Full Stack Integration

1. **Run Django backend** (API endpoints).
    
2. **Run React frontend** (with Vite).
    
3. **Connect them**: React fetches data from Django’s API.
    
4. **Authentication flow**: Login/signup in React → handled by Django backend.
    
5. **Deploy**:
    
    - Backend: Deploy Django + PostgreSQL on services like Heroku, Render, or AWS.
        
    - Frontend: Deploy React + Tailwind on Netlify or Vercel.
        

## ✅ How to Start Practically

- Begin with **Python + Django basics** first.
    
- Once you can build a simple CRUD app with Django + PostgreSQL, move to **React + Tailwind**.
    
- Finally, connect them with DRF APIs.
    

🔑 **Key advice:** Don’t try to learn both sides at once. Start with Django until you’re comfortable, then move to React + Tailwind. Once you’ve built something on each side, integrate them — that’s when you truly become full stack.
