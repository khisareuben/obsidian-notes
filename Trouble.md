I know i don't have the right to talk about this coz am only your friend but i just wanted to know and also to thank you for it. Do you always think about that day where we slept on the same place?
I have never been that close to a woman before and you are the first and the only one upto now, that's why its so special to me. The most amazing thing about that moment was how you took my hand and placed it where it should be, removed the barrier(blanket) between us so that we can come together. You gave yourself to me, its something that i will never take for granted again and i wouldn't like anyone to do that except for you(and i would like to give myself to you and only you).
We were not driven by our lack of self control but it was a natural thing for two people who love each other as we were both in self control that's why we didn't take it far or cross the line.
I never said this but i want to thank you for that day as you made me feel like i belonged to you and you to me and that is very important for me. You might have forgoten it but as long as i have it in my heart then it will not fade away.
I just wanted to show you that i haven't forgoten about it and it's significant to me(us). Thank you for that special moment.
And forgive me if i have offended you or disgraced you or brought indignity on you by talking about this. I respect you, you are the kind of woman i would like to spend the rest of my life with though we are just friends

I want to tell you something about myself. I have always been afraid of being with someone, because i have always been unsure of what my future holds and i didn't want to make someone suffer with me if i didn't succeed in life. Reality is very cruel, i have never wanted to make a family in a failure kind of environment and make the woman i love to suffer. You can indeed say that i have been afraid of failure, i would rather suffer alone that make someone else suffer with me.
Am a strong believer of being stable first then look for love, but what will happen when you find love first before being stable? How sure are you that you will succeed in life to honour that love? How long will it take? Will she wait till that time? Will that time even come?
Am was really scared of that, and i don't know the right thing to do. Maybe am right in my fear or ideology, maybe i am wrong.
I tell you this because i trust you completely and i have never trusted anyone like this and you are my only dear friend. 
So as my only friend, i just want to know what you think about all this. And i am ready to listen to you, because i know our friendship is genuine and i don't know much about life like you do because i have never interacted with other people to understand what they feel or experience but i know you have,me being an example :)
