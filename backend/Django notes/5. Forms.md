# creating forms

- First you need to create `forms.py`  file inside the app directory

```python
from django import forms

SHIFTS = (
		  ("1", "Morning"),
		  ("2", "Afternoon"),
		  ("3", "Evening"),
)

class InputForm(forms.Form):
	first_name = forms.CharField(max_length = 200)
	last_name = forms.CharField(max_length = 200)
	shif = forms.ChoiceField(choices = SHIFTS)
	time_log = forms.TimeField()
```

Create a view for the form

**views.py (myapp)**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

from myapp.forms import InputForm

def form_view(request):
	form = InputForm
	context = {"form" : form}
	return render(request, "home.html", context)
```


create a templates folder inside the app and then create a home.html inside the templates folder

#### templates/home.html

```html
<p> Hello </p>

<form action = "" method = "post">
	{% csrf_token %}
	{{form.as_p}}

	<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

next got to `views.py`  in the app folder

```python
...

urlpatterns = [
	path('home/', views.form_view)
]
```


make changes to the settings accordingly
