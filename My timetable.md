Muslim WAKES UP & REALIZES Muhammad is FALSE Prophet | Sam Shamoun The Quran acknowledges Muhammad's sins and his need for forgiveness. In Surah 40:55, Allah tells Muhammad to seek forgiveness for his sins, showing he wasn't perfect. Surah 47:19 also tells him to ask forgiveness for his sins and for the believing men and women. These verses go against the Islamic belief that prophets are sinless. Surah 80:1-10 tells about a time when Muhammad frowned at a blind man seeking guidance, choosing to talk to rich pagans instead, showing a moral failing. Surah 33:37 talks about Muhammad marrying Zaynab, the divorced wife of his adopted son Zaid, which was controversial and led to the end of legal adoption in Islam.
