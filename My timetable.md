### Clear Memory Cache (RAM)

Open a terminal and run:

bash

```
sudo sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

üîç What this does:

- `sync`: flushes filesystem buffers to disk.
    
- `echo 3`: clears PageCache (1), dentries (2), and inodes (4).
    
- `tee`: ensures the command runs with elevated permissions.
    

You can also target specific caches:

- `echo 1`: clears PageCache only.
    
- `echo 2`: clears dentries and inodes.

Muslim WAKES UP & REALIZES Muhammad is FALSE Prophet | Sam Shamoun The Quran acknowledges Muhammad's sins and his need for forgiveness. In Surah 40:55, Allah tells Muhammad to seek forgiveness for his sins, showing he wasn't perfect. Surah 47:19 also tells him to ask forgiveness for his sins and for the believing men and women. These verses go against the Islamic belief that prophets are sinless. Surah 80:1-10 tells about a time when Muhammad frowned at a blind man seeking guidance, choosing to talk to rich pagans instead, showing a moral failing. Surah 33:37 talks about Muhammad marrying Zaynab, the divorced wife of his adopted son Zaid, which was controversial and led to the end of legal adoption in Islam.
