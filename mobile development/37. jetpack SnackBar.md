A **Snackbar** in Jetpack Compose is a small, lightweight message that appears at the **bottom of the screen** to provide brief feedback about an operation. Itâ€™s part of the **Material Design** system and is used to inform users of a process without interrupting their experience.

### ðŸ§  Imagine This:

You show a snackbar that says:

> "No internet connection" > [Retry]

Now the user has two choices:

1. Tap **Retry** â†’ this triggers `SnackbarResult.ActionPerformed`
    
2. Ignore it or swipe it away â†’ this triggers `SnackbarResult.Dismissed`


```kotlin

val snackbarHostState = remember { SnackbarHostState() }  
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()  
  
Scaffold(  
    snackbarHost = {  
        SnackbarHost(hostState = snackbarHostState)  
    }  
) { padding ->  
    Box(  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .fillMaxSize()  
            .padding(padding),  
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center  
    ) {  
        Button(  
            onClick = {  
                scope.launch {  
                    val result = snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(  
                        message = "Jetpack compose",  
                        actionLabel = "Retry",  
                        withDismissAction = true, //this is the close icon  
                        duration = SnackbarDuration.Short  
                    )  
                    when(result) {  
                        SnackbarResult.Dismissed -> {}  
                        SnackbarResult.ActionPerformed -> {}  
                    }  
                }  
  
            }        ) {  
            Text(text = "Show Snackbar")  
        }  
    }}

```

the `when` part is not necessarily needed in this simple example but its just to show you when you need it, this is how you do it
