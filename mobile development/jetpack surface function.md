This answers the question when should we use surface 


In Jetpack Compose, the `Surface` composable is a versatile and essential component that provides a container for your UI elements. It's designed to handle common properties like background color, elevation, shape, and more. Here are some key scenarios when you should consider using `Surface`:

1. **Applying Background Color:** Use `Surface` to apply a background color to a section of your UI. For example, you might want to highlight a specific area with a different color.

    
    ```kotlin
    Surface(
        color = MaterialTheme.colors.primary
    ) {
        Text("This is inside a Surface with a primary color background")
    }
    ```
    
2. **Handling Elevation:** Elevation is important for creating a sense of depth in your UI. `Surface` makes it easy to apply elevation and shadows.
    
    
    
    ```kotlin
    Surface(
        elevation = 4.dp
    ) {
        Text("This Surface has elevation")
    }
    ```
    
3. **Applying Shape:** If you want to apply a specific shape to your UI element, such as rounded corners, `Surface` can help you achieve that.
    
    
    
    ```kotlin
    Surface(
        shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
    ) {
        Text("This Surface has rounded corners")
    }
    ```
    
4. **Handling Clicks:** `Surface` can also handle click events, making it useful for creating clickable UI components.
    
    
    
    ```kotlin
    Surface(
        onClick = { /* handle click */ }
    ) {
        Text("This Surface is clickable")
    }
    ```
    
5. **Creating Visual Separation:** Use `Surface` to visually separate different sections of your UI, providing a clear distinction between elements.
    
    
    
    ```kotlin
    Column {
        Surface(
            color = MaterialTheme.colors.surface
        ) {
            Text("Section 1")
        }
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))
        Surface(
            color = MaterialTheme.colors.surface
        ) {
            Text("Section 2")
        }
    }
    ```
    
6. **Custom Styling:** `Surface` allows you to apply custom styles, like borders or padding, to your UI elements.
    
    
    
    ```kotlin
    Surface(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp),
        border = BorderStroke(1.dp, Color.Gray)
    ) {
        Text("This Surface has custom padding and border")
    }
    ```
