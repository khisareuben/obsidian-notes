`TextField` - for inputs
`Snackbar` - is like an error/notification box

`state` - state is a container that holds a value that can change over time e.g. 

```kotlin
var count by remember {mutableStateOf(0)}
```

`Recomposition` - is the process of re-executing composable function when their inputs change

`LazyColumn` - is used to create large content which is scrollable

# View models

`private val mainViewModel by viewModels<MainViewModel>()` mainActivity

`mainViewModel.counter.observeAsState().value`

`var counter = MutableLiveData<Int>(0)` viewModel




### **1. Define the App’s Purpose & User Needs**

Before designing the UI, developers **clarify the app’s goals**—what problem does it solve, and who will use it? They conduct **user research** to understand the needs and behaviors of their target audience.

### 🔹 **2. Sketching & Wireframing (Low-Fidelity Design)**

This is where **rough layouts** are created to map out screens and navigation flow. Designers (or developers) use tools like:

- 📝 **Pen & paper** for quick sketches
    
- 🖥 **Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch** for digital wireframes
    
- 📱 **Whimsical or Balsamiq** for rapid prototyping
    

At this stage, there’s no styling—just basic elements like **buttons, text fields, and navigation**.

### 🔹 **3. Creating UI Mockups (High-Fidelity Design)**

Once wireframes are approved, designers create **detailed mockups** with colors, fonts, and assets. Popular tools include:

- 🎨 **Figma** (widely used for UI/UX)
    
- 📐 **Adobe XD**
    
- 🖌 **Canva** (for quick visuals)
    

Mockups help finalize how the app **looks and feels** before coding starts.

### 🔹 **4. Interaction Design & Prototyping**

To refine usability, designers create **interactive prototypes** that allow users to **click through** and experience the app flow before development begins. Tools like:

- **Figma (Prototypes)**
    
- **InVision**
    
- **ProtoPie**
    

These help identify **pain points** in navigation and layout.

### 🔹 **5. Translating Design to Jetpack Compose**

Now comes the coding part! Developers break down the UI into **Composable functions**, implementing the design using:

- **Material Theme & Typography**
    
- **Layouts (Column, Row, Box)**
    
- **Modifiers for styling**
    
- **Dynamic animations (Lottie, Motion API)**
    

This is where **Jetpack Compose magic** happens, bringing the UI to life!
