```kotlin
 Button(  
    onClick = { onClick() },  
    colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(  
      containerColor = Color.Red, // Change this 
      contentColor = Color.White // Change the text 
    )  
  ) {  
    Text("Filled")  
  }  
}
```


## To create a toast

This is to show a toast when the button is clicked

```kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current  
Box(  
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),  
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center  
){  
    Button(  
        onClick = {  
            Toast.makeText(context, "Button Clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()  
        }  
    ){  
        Text("Simple Text")  
    }  
  
}
```


**Note:** 

Jetpack Compose gives you a solid lineup of button styles to match different levels of emphasis and design needs. As of now, there are **five main types** of Material 3 buttons:

1. **Filled Button** – The default high-emphasis button with a solid background. Great for primary actions like “Submit” or “Save.”
    
2. **Filled Tonal Button** – Similar to filled, but with a softer background tone. Ideal when you want emphasis without shouting.
    
3. **Elevated Button** – Has a shadow to lift it off the surface. Useful when you want a button to stand out subtly, especially on flat backgrounds.
    
4. **Outlined Button** – Just a border, no fill. Medium emphasis, often used for secondary actions like “Cancel.”
    
5. **Text Button** – No border or background. Low emphasis, perfect for things like “Learn more” or “Skip.”
