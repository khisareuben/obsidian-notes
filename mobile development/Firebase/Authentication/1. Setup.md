You can check how to connect your project with firebase in the database section

Go to the firebase console:

`Build` -> `Authentication` -> `Sign-in method` -> `Enable Email/Password`


1. Enable internet permissions

```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />  
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

```


For `Google` Authentication


`Build` -> `Authentication` -> `Sign-in method` -> `Add new provider` -> `Chose Google` -> `Add your support email` -> `Save` 

NOTE : Delete the old json file and add the new .json file

You can find it at :

Go to `project settings` and down below you'll see the .json file


To paste the file in you project first switch to `project` view instead of `android` view and paste it under the `app` section
