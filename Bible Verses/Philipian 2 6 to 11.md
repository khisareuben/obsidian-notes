Who, being in very natureGod,  
    did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;  
7 rather, he made himself nothing  
    by taking the very nature of a servant,  
    being made in human likeness.  
8 And being found in appearance as a man,  
    he humbled himself  
    by becoming obedient to death—  
        even death on a cross!
