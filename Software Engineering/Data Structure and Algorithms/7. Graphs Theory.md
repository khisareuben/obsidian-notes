# Graphs
Is a collection of vertices and edges. vertices represent data and edges represents relationship between the vertices.

#### 1. Directional graph
You can go forward but not backwards.

#### 2. Unidirectional graph 

You can go forward and backward. It doesn't have arrowheads

we will use has map (dictionaries) in python

		{key : value}

we will have a dictionary which has **keys** as the nodes and **Value** corresponding to every of the keys is going to be all the connection it has with other nodes.
This format is known as an **adjacency list**
