# Graph practice
we will write the coding implementation of the **BFS** and **DFS** algorithms

#### 1. Depth First Search (DFS) [stack]

It uses stack in order to traverse through the list

```python

graph = {
	"a" : ["b", "d"],
	"b" : [],
	"c" : [],
	"d" : ["e", "g"],
	"e" : ["c"],
	"f" : [],
	"g" : ["f"],
		
}

def dfs(graph, source):
	stack = []
	stack.append(source)
	while stack:
		node = stack.pop(-1)
		print(node, end= " ")
		for neighbour in graph[node]:
			stack.append(neighbour)

dfs(graph, "a")
	
```


#### 2. Breadth first search [queue]

It use queue in order to traverse through the list

```python
graph = {
	"a" : ["b", "d"],
	"b" : [],
	"c" : [],
	"d" : ["e", "g"],
	"e" : ["c"],
	"f" : [],
	"g" : ["f"],
		
}

def bfs(graph, source):
	queue = []
	queue.append(source)
	while queue:
		node = queue.pop(0)
		print(node, end=" ")
		for neighbours in graph[node]:
			queue.append(neighbours)

bfs(graph, "a")
```
