1. **Use** `pip-tools` **to Upgrade Dependencies**: Install `pip-tools` to help manage your dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    pip install pip-tools
    ```
    
    Create a new `requirements.in` file if you don't already have one and list your top-level dependencies:
    
    text
    
    ```
    celery
    other_dependencies
    ```
    
    Run `pip-compile` to generate a new `requirements.txt` with the latest compatible versions:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    pip-compile requirements.in
    ```
    
2. **Install Updated Dependencies**: Once you have your updated `requirements.txt`, install the dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. **Verify Compatibility**: Ensure that the updated dependencies are compatible with your project. Test your application thoroughly to identify any issues.
    

By following these steps, you can upgrade your dependencies to match the compatible versions with the latest `pip` and avoid the metadata issues you encountered with `celery==4.3.0`. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
