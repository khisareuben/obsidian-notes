### 1. Introduction to Django

- Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    
- Follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
    
- Provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database manipulation.
    

### 2. Setting Up a Django Project

- **Create a project directory**:

	```bash
	mkdir <name>
	cd name
```
    
- **create a virtual environment**:

	```bash
	python3 -m venv <name-env>
	
	source name-env/Scripts/activate
```
    
- **create django project**: 

	```bash
	pip3 install django
	
	python3 -m django version

	django-admin startproject <project-name>
```

- **Run development server**: 

	```bash
	cd project-name
	python3 manage.py runserver
```
- Access the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


## How to create an app in django

An app is just different sections of the website, e.g `home` `about` `contacts`  and others
This should be done inside the projects folder

```bash
python -m django startapp myapp
```

Then go to settings.py and let it know that you have myapp folder
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [

    'django.contrib.admin',

    'django.contrib.auth',

    'django.contrib.contenttypes',

    'django.contrib.sessions',

    'django.contrib.messages',

    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    'myapp',

]
```


### 3. Django Project Structure

- **[manage.py](https://manage.py/?form=MG0AV3)**: Command-line utility for project management.
    
- **projectname/**: Main project folder.
    
    - **[settings.py](https://settings.py/?form=MG0AV3)**: Configuration settings.
        
    - **[urls.py](https://urls.py/?form=MG0AV3)**: URL declarations.
        
    - **[wsgi.py](https://wsgi.py/?form=MG0AV3)**: WSGI configuration for deployment.
        
    - **[asgi.py](https://asgi.py/?form=MG0AV3)**: ASGI configuration for deployment.
        

### 4. Views and URL Routing

- **Define Views**: Create view functions in `views.py`.
- views handle http requests and response

	```python
	from django.http import HttpResponse
	def home(request):
		content = "<html><body><h1>Welcome to django</h1></body></html>"
		return HttpResponse(content)
```
    
## Routing
This is mapping a url to a view function
You need to create a new file inside the app folder, not the project folder e.g `myapp/urls.py`

#### urls.py(app)
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
#first argument is the route which is a stiring that contains the url pattern
# the second contain the view and the name of the view function
			   path('', views.home, name='home')
]
```


## URL configuration

Django create a `urls.py` in the projects folder but its best practice to create a `urls.py` in the app folder
you need the `include()` function to tell django to also check the urls file in app folder 

### urls.py (project folder)

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from myapp import views

urlpatterns = [
			   path('admin/', admin.site.urls)
			   path('', include('myapp.urls'))
			   # change the myapp accordingly
]
```


## http
it uses four methods: 
`GET`  - retrieve information from the given server
`POST` - send data to the server
`PUT` - updates whatever exists in the sever with something else
`DELETE` - removes the resource

### http status code
- Informational - `100 - 199`
- Successful - `200 - 299`
- Redirection - `300 - 399`
- Client error - `400 - 499`
- Sever error - `500 - 599`

## 1 : 37 angle brackets and path converters

##### urls.py (myapp folder)
```python
from django.urls import path
from myapp import views

urlpatterns = [
			   path('dishes/<str:dish>', views.menuitems)
			   
]
```

#### views.py (myapp)
```python
form django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def menuitems(request, dish)
	items = {
		"pasta" : "is a noodle food"
		"falafel" : "deep fired patties"
		"cheesecake" : "is a type of dessert"
	}

	description = items[dish]
	return HttpResponse(f"<h2> {dish} </h2> + discription)
```


## Regular expressions

- They define url patterns in django
	 this is like the angle brackets and path converters but it allows you to create a single page instead of creating different pages for `pasta`  `falafel`  `cheesecake`

- **RegEx** which means regular expressions are a set of characters that specify a pattern and are used to search for or find patterns in a string. They perform
		`Extraction and validation`
		`Advanced seaching`
		`Group searches`
		`Find and replace`

	 e.g  r ' ^menu_item/ ([0 - 9] {2}) /$ '
