**A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer**

The commonly used elements are:

``<header>  <footer> <nav> <aside> <main> <article> <section>

## header

This is generally found at the top of a document, and article or a section and it contains the main heading or title of that section, document or article. It can also contain navigation and even search elements.

## footer
This is similar to the header in pretty much every way, except you usually find it at the bottom of a document, article or section. It usually contains meta information like copyright data, author details, various links that don't belong anywhere else and so on.

## nav
The nav element contains navigation links, either within the same document or to other documents. Examples include breadcrumbs, menus and tables of content.

### aside
This holds content that's related to the main content, but it's not really part of it. For Example, you could use an aside element to display a definition of a certain term used in the main content. its like a side-not if you will.

### main
The main element represents the dominant content in a document. It other words, holds content that is directly related to the main topic of the document. For example, in a blog post, the content of the post should be placed in a main element.

### section and article
Both of these are good for sectioning content and you'll often see them being used interchangeably. Which one you should use and when depends on the context. Usually, an article is used for content that can be distributed independently while a section should be used more for grouping related content.
