The remote repository contain changes that you don't

The error you're seeing occurs because your local repository is behind the remote repository. This usually happens when changes have been made to the remote repository that you don't have in your local copy. To resolve this, you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository into your local repository before you can push your changes.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    git fetch origin
    ```
    
2. **Merge the fetched changes into your local branch**:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    git merge origin/master
    ```
    
3. **Resolve any merge conflicts** if they arise. You'll need to manually edit the conflicting files and then commit the resolved changes.
    
4. **Push your changes to the remote repository**:
    
    bash
    
    ```
    git push origin master
    ```
    

If you prefer a simpler approach, you can use `git pull` which combines the fetch and merge steps into one:

bash

```
git pull origin master
```

After pulling the changes, you can push your changes without any issues:

bash

```
git push origin master
```

This should solve the problem. Let me know if you need any more help with Git!
