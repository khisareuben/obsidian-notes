## Kotlin Syntax

In the previous chapter, we created a Kotlin file called `Main.kt`, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello World")
}
```

### Example explained

The `fun` keyword is used to declare a function. A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. In the example above, it declares the `main()` function.

The `main()` function is something you will see in every Kotlin program. This function is used to **execute** code. Any code inside the `main()` function's curly brackets `{}` will be **executed**.

For example, the `println()` function is inside the `main()` function, meaning that this will be executed. The `println()` function is used to output/print text, and in our example it will output "Hello World".

**Good To Know:** In Kotlin, code statements do not have to end with a semicolon (`;`) (which is often required for other programming languages, such as [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp), [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp), [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp), etc.).

## Main Parameters

Before Kotlin version 1.3, it was required to use the `main()` function with parameters, like: `fun main(args : Array<String>)`. The example above had to be written like this to work:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main(args : Array<String>) {
  println("Hello World")
}
```

**Note:** This is no longer required, and the program will run fine without it. However, it will not do any harm if you have been using it in the past, and will continue to use it.
