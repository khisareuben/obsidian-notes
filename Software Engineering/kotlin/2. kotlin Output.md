## Kotlin Output (Print)

The `println()` function is used to output values/print text:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello World")
}
```

You can add as many `println()` functions as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each function:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello World!")
  println("I am learning Kotlin.")
  println("It is awesome!")
}
```

You can also print numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println(3 + 3)
}
```

## The print() function

There is also a `print()` function, which is similar to `println()`. The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

### Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
  print("Hello World! ")
  print("I am learning Kotlin. ")
  print("It is awesome!")
}
```

Note that we have added a space character to create a space between the sentences.
