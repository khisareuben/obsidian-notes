## Kotlin Classes/Objects

Everything in Kotlin is associated with classes and objects, along with its properties and functions. For example: in real life, a car is an **object**. The car has **properties**, such as brand, weight and color, and **functions**, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Create a Class

To create a class, use the `class` keyword, and specify the name of the class:

### Example

Create a **Car** class along with some **properties** (brand, model and year)

```kotlin
class Car {
  var brand = ""
  var model = ""
  var year = 0
} 
```

A **property** is basically a [**variable**](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/kotlin_variables.php) that belongs to the class.

**Good to Know:** It is considered good practice to start the name of a class with an upper case letter, for better organization.

## Create an Object

Now we can use the class named **Car** to create objects.

In the example below, we create an object of **Car** called **c1**, and then we access the properties of **c1** by using the dot syntax (`.`), just like we did to access array and string properties:

### Example

```kotlin
// Create a c1 object of the Car class
val c1 = Car()

// Access the properties and add some values to it
c1.brand = "Ford"
c1.model = "Mustang"
c1.year = 1969

println(c1.brand)   // Outputs Ford
println(c1.model)   // Outputs Mustang
println(c1.year)    // Outputs 1969 
```

## Multiple Objects

You can create multiple objects of one class:

### Example

```kotlin
val c1 = Car()
c1.brand = "Ford"
c1.model = "Mustang"
c1.year = 1969

val c2 = Car()
c2.brand = "BMW"
c2.model = "X5"
c2.year = 1999

println(c1.brand)  // Ford
println(c2.brand)  // BMW
```
