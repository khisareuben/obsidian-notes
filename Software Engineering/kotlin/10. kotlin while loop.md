## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

## Kotlin While Loop

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`:

### Syntax

```kotlin
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as the counter variable (i) is less than 5:

### Example

```kotlin
var i = 0
while (i < 5) {
  println(i)
  i++
} 
```

**Note:** Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end.

## The Do..While Loop

The `do..while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

### Syntax

```kotlin
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

The example below uses a `do/while` loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

### Example

```kotlin
var i = 0
do {
  println(i)
  i++
  }
while (i < 5) 
```

Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!
