## Kotlin For Loop

Often when you work with arrays, you need to loop through all of the elements.

To loop through array elements, use the `for` loop together with the `in` operator:

### Example

Output all elements in the cars array:

```kotlin
val cars = arrayOf("Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda")
for (x in cars) {
  println(x)
}
```

You can loop through all kinds of arrays. In the example above, we used an array of strings.

In the example below, we loop through an array of integers:

### Example

```kotlin
val nums = arrayOf(1, 5, 10, 15, 20)
for (x in nums) {
  println(x)
}
```

## Traditional For Loop

Unlike Java and other programming languages, there is no traditional `for` loop in Kotlin.

In Kotlin, the `for` loop is used to loop through arrays, ranges, and other things that contains a countable number of values.

You will learn more about **ranges** in the next chapter - which will create a range of values.
