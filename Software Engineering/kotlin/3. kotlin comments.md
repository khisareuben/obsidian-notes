## Kotlin Comments

Comments can be used to explain Kotlin code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments starts with two forward slashes (`//`).

Any text between `//` and the end of the line is ignored by Kotlin (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

### Example

```kotlin
// This is a comment
println("Hello World") 
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by Kotlin.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

### Example

```kotlin
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
println("Hello World")  
```
