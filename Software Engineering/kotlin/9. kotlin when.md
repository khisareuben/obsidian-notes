## Kotlin when

Instead of writing many `if..else` expressions, you can use the `when` expression, which is much easier to read.

It is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed:

### Example

Use the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```kotlin
val day = 4

val result = when (day) {
  1 -> "Monday"
  2 -> "Tuesday"
  3 -> "Wednesday"
  4 -> "Thursday"
  5 -> "Friday"
  6 -> "Saturday"
  7 -> "Sunday"
  else -> "Invalid day."
}
println(result)

// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```

The `when` expression is similar to the `switch` statement in Java.

This is how it works:

- The `when` variable (**day**) is evaluated once
- The value of the **day** variable is compared with the values of each "branch"
- Each branch starts with a value, followed by an arrow (->) and a result
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
- `else` is used to specify some code to run if there is no match
- In the example above, the value of `day` is `4`, meaning "Thursday" will be printed
